Question 4: Examine the top 10 pages by PageRank and the top 10 by inlink count in the Lemur Web Interface

Let us consider the first 2 pages of the pages sorted by PageRank and Inlink Count. Their document id's are WT21-B37-76 and 
WT21-B37-75. The page with document id WT21-B37-76 and WT21-B37-75 may have a higher page rank value because of the number 
of inlink counts in both of these pages i.e. 2568 and 1704 and they may possibly contain pages with higher page rank values.
Let us consider the remaining pages of the list sorted on the page rank values :
Example 1: WT25-B39-116 i.e. it may have high page rank value 
because it has an inlink count of 169 and moreover it is also linking it to itself, so that is the reason that it may be having a higher
page rank value.
Example 2: WT23-B21-53, it has an inlink count of 198 and outlink count of 1 which points to itself making it a strong contender for a 
higher page rank.
Example 3: WT08-B18-400, based on the page rank value it stands at position 10. One of the major reasons is the higher inlink count for 
this particular document id. It has an inlink count of 990 but a zero outlink count.

Let us check whether all of these documents are what user's would be looking for in response to an appropriate query: 
Let's take an example: 
docID: WT27-B28-203,WT08-B18-40 stands at position 10 in the pages sorted by inlink count and stands at position 10 in the pages sorted 
by rank.
Both takes us to the home page of TD Bank which most of the users would be looking for and it can be categorized as interesting to most 
of the users if they are looking for an online banking system.

docID: WT13-B06-284 stands at position 10 in pages sorted by page rank.
It takes us to legalresearch.com which might be interesting to many users searching for legal advice and due to high inlink count it has 
a higher page rank value.

docID: WT24-B40-171 stands at position 6 in the pages sorted by page rank.
It redirects to http://www.chch.com/live/ which is live streaming of tv shows and it is of great interest to users looking for online tv 
shows. Also this link has an inlink count on the higher side i.e. 270.

docID: WT23-B21-53 stands at position at position 4 in the pages sorted by page rank.
It redirects to https://search.yahoo.com/yhs/errorhandler?hspart=gt&hsimp=yhse-gt&q=www.sea.usscouts.org%2Fteam.html%20206.26.8.102%2019970210180409%20text%2F&type=808263
which cannot be of interest to users who search for "sea us scout team" but has higher page rank value because of inlink count 198 and 
link to itself.

In short, pages with high inlink count can have a higher page rank value but it will hold true for the first few pages of the data set. 
Generally, pages may have a higher page rank value even if they don't have a relatively high inlink count but if they are linked with 
pages that already have a high page rank value.
Also pages have a higher page rank value if they have a higher inlink count and also are pointing to itself.

So the page rank result obtained has the first 2 documents in both the pages sorted by page rank and the pages sorted by inlink count as 
the same but they start to differ going forward as the page with a higher page rank value may be having an inlink whose page rank is of 
higher value and this needs to be taken into consideration and given a higher priority than the inlink count.
